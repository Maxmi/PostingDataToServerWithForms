This is my solution to the exercise "Posting Data To The Server With A Form"
in Phase-2 on Learners Guild Curriculum.
Built using express.js and pug templating.


Submitting a form with GET request sends data as a query string and response is a json file with query parameters.

Submitting a form with POST request sends data in the body and response is a a json file with body parameters.
